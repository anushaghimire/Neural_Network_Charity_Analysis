# Overview of the analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the study is to use the features in the provided dataset which is a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years, and help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
